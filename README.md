# Raspberry-Pi-project_Face-Recognition-Door-Lock
This is a course project for ECE 5725 at Cornell University.

The main objectives of our system include face recognition and passcode function.
Users could operate on a touchscreen to select entering the house by recognizing face or entering passcode. 
For face recognition, an image will be captured by pi camera and preprocessed by Raspberry pi like converting, resizing and cropping. Then face detection and recognition are performed. Once the face is recognized by the classifier based on pre-stored image library,  the image will be sent to a remote console waiting for house ownerâ€™s decision.
For passcode function, users could enter or reset passcode through a keypad.
